If the T is stuck between two vowels, it is pronounced as a D. If it is after an N, it is not pronounced. I heard people pronounce “dentist” as “denist”. The American “t” can be a bit tricky if you are not used to it (or hearing it).</description></item><item><title>Spinarak (Pokmon) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</title><link>/spinarak-pok-c3-a9mon.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/spinarak-pok-c3-a9mon.html</guid><description>Spinarak (Japanese: イトマル Itomaru) is a dual-type Bug/Poison Pokémon introduced in Generation II.
