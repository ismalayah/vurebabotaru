Maddie and her younger twin siblings were put to bed in an apartment about 100m away and left unattended.</p><p>According to Kate, the adults - now dubbed the <a href=#>Tapas Nine</a> - had a rota system to check on all the children about every hour that evening. Gerry had checked his children at 9.05pm. They were all accounted for. Eventually, it was Kate’s turn to check on the unaccompanied children to make sure they were safe and sound.</p><p>Their lives would turn upside down when she opened the apartment door about 10pm to find Maddie wasn’t there. Her cot was empty and all that was visible were a blanket and a cuddly toy. The police were immediately called while staff and guests searched the complex everywhere for any sign of the 3-year-old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/ldizGHmvxLOY5NWM3cZu_zvpizo=/16x9/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/J6XWJ54F6NVO3UH6744RHLE3MM.jpg"><p>As the sun rose on May 4, there was still no sign of Maddie.

A month later British police send sniffer dogs to assist and search the apartment and rental car the McCanns used. A hundred days after she disappeared, police admit she might not be alive.</p><p>On September 7, 2007, <a href=#>Kate and Gerry McCann</a> were named as “arguidos”, or “official suspects”, in their daughter’s disappearance and were both interrogated by local police.
